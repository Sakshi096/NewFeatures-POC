# Face Clustering Proof of Concept (PoC)

This repository demonstrates a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for clustering images with similar facial expressions or poses using the **InsightFace** library's `buffalo_l` model. The PoC loads images, extracts facial embeddings, and clusters them based on similarity.

## Overview

This project was designed to:
1. **Group similar faces** based on subtle variations (expressions, poses).
2. Use **face embeddings** to create clusters of faces with minimal manual effort.
3. Serve as a foundation for more advanced features like keyword-based image search, similar face detection, and auto-collage generation.

### How It Works

1. **Image Processing**: Each image is processed to extract face embeddings using `buffalo_l`.
2. **Clustering**: DBSCAN clustering is used to group similar faces by calculating the cosine similarity of embeddings.
3. **Results Logging**: Clustering results are displayed in the console, showing groups of images with similar faces.
